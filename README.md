### Instruction on how to compile and run program
-------------------------------------------------
Recommended software: Tuffix 

Recommended Compiler: Visual Studios Code

Unzip file and open it using Visual Studios code. Make sure to have C++ add on installed. Save the file to a folder in your computer. Under the "Terminal" tab go to "Configure Default Build Task" and scroll to "C/C++:g++ build active file". This will create a seperate tab with the "tasks.json" file. Go back to our program (it will be a .cpp file) and under "Terminal" click "Run Build Task". This will create a small terminal on the bottom of the screen. On the far left there will be a "+" sign. This will create a new terminal where you can run the program by entering ./swap.
